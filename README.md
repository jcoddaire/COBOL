# COBOL
COBOL Source Code for CIS 253 as taught by GVSU

Hi. I took a COBOL course at GVSU in 2013. Here's the fruit of my labor. You are welcome to revivew it!

PR's are awesome!

Current students: if you want to show off your own work,the AS400 is pretty much an unsecured FTP server. Drop into port 22 and extract your work!

Seriously though I would recommend skipping COBOL if you can. Try learning a language on this page:
